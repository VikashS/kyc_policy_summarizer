## Use Case: Automated KYC Policy Summarization for Audit Preparedness
Scenario:

I am Vikash, a Compliance Officer at Richie Bank, a renowned bank in the Netherlands. My team is preparing for an audit by De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB). Our challenge is to distill the bank's extensive, 100+ page KYC Policy—recently updated to align with the Autoriteit Financiële Markten (AFM) and DNB Master Direction (as of August 2025)—into a concise briefing for our branch managers.

Manually summarizing this dense, jargon-heavy document, which covers AML/CFT risks, customer acceptance rules, risk categorization, identification procedures, and transaction monitoring, is a painstaking process. It is time-intensive, prone to human error, and carries the risk of missing critical legal references or requirements.

## Solution: Generative AI Summarization Tool

This use case implements a secure, AI-powered tool to automate the summarization process. The solution ingests the full policy document and generates a structured, accurate summary of approximately 200-300 words. It includes a validation step to ensure all key mandatory elements (e.g., "risk assessment," "customer identification") are present. This drastically reduces review time, improves accuracy, and provides a verifiable audit trail.

## Key Benefits:

Efficiency: Reduces summarization time from hours to minutes.

Accuracy & Consistency: Ensures all summaries are complete and uniformly structured.

Audit-Ready: Provides a document hash for traceability and proof of content authenticity.

Security: Deployed on-premises to protect sensitive financial data.

Oversight: Includes a human-in-the-loop step to review and catch any potential AI "hallucinations" (fabricated inaccuracies).

## Workflow After Implementation:

1> Receive: The latest KYC policy document is received from the legal or compliance committee.

2> Upload: A user securely uploads the document (e.g., a PDF) to the bank's internal web portal.

3> Process: The application extracts the raw text and breaks it into manageable chunks for analysis.

4> Summarize & Validate: The text chunks are processed by a pre-trained AI model using a specific prompt:

5> Example Prompt: "Summarize this KYC policy document. Focus on key requirements, procedures, risk assessment methodologies, and compliance obligations. Ensure the output is concise (200-300 words), uses clear language, and is structured under the following headers: Key Requirements, Procedures, Risk Assessments, Compliance Obligations."

6> The system then validates the output to confirm the presence of mandatory key terms.

7> Review: If validation fails, the summary is flagged for manual review by a compliance officer (like Vikash). If it passes, it proceeds.

8> Output: The tool generates a final, structured JSON output.

  "key_requirements": "Mandatory customer identification and verification at onboarding and for periodic updates. Prohibition of anonymous accounts; explicit KYC information (e.g., official ID, proof of address) must be collected. Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) is required for high-risk customers as defined by DNB/AFM regulations.",
  "procedures": "Customer Acceptance: Refuse non-cooperative applicants. Identification (CIP): Verify identity via official documents (e.g., passport, national ID). Ongoing Monitoring: Continuously track transactions for suspicious patterns; report unusual activities to the relevant authorities as mandated.",
  "risk_assessments": "Customers are categorized as Low (e.g., salaried employees at well-established firms), Medium (e.g., local businesses with variable cash flow), or High Risk (e.g., Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs), cross-border correspondent relationships). EDD and annual reviews are mandatory for high-risk categories.",
  "compliance_obligations": "Full adherence to the Dutch Financial Supervision Act (Wft), DNB/AFM directives, and EU AML directives. Regular staff training is mandatory. Maintain all records for a minimum of 5 years. Reporting obligations must be fulfilled through appointed compliance officers.",
  "full_summary": "Richie Bank's KYC Policy mandates rigorous client verification to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing, in full compliance with DNB and AFM regulations. Key requirements include verified identification at onboarding and a prohibition on anonymous accounts. Procedures involve customer identification programs and ongoing transaction monitoring. Risks are tiered (Low, Medium, High), with Enhanced Due Diligence required for high-risk clients. Compliance obligations emphasize adherence to Dutch and EU law, staff training, and strict record keeping. (Word count: 250)",

## Final Outcome for the Compliance Team (Vikash):

Instant Distribution: I now have a digestible, accurate briefing. I can email it to all branch managers within minutes instead of dedicating hours or days to manual work.

Audit Trail: The summary is audit-ready, with a unique document hash (original_hash) providing traceability back to the exact source document.

Easy Updates: If the policy is updated (e.g., due to a new DNB rule), I simply re-upload the new document to generate a fresh summary instantly.

Future Integration: The system can be integrated with the bank's CRM to automatically summarize customer-specific KYC notes, further streamlining operations.




### Notes:

KYC Policy: A document containing guidelines for customer onboarding, risk assessment, and ongoing monitoring to prevent money laundering (ML) and terrorist financing (TF). Manually reviewing these policies is notoriously time-consuming.

Regulatory Context in the Netherlands: KYC policies for banks are primarily enforced and supervised by De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) and the Autoriteit Financiële Markten (AFM).
